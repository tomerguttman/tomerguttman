# Hey! I'm Tomer ğŸ‘‹

I'm a backend and site reliability engineer, wrangling technologies like TypeScript, Kubernetes, Docker, Prometheus, Grafana, and more on a daily basis. I've also spent plenty of time in the world of data and streaming, working with Kafka, Elasticsearch, Cassandra, Debezium, MySQL, and Snowflake. While my main focus is backend and infrastructure, I also know a bit of frontend kung-fu â€” just enough React to occasionally punch out a UI when needed. ğŸ¥‹
